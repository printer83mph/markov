Open on one-on-one basketball game with M-Awesome. B-Dawg is losing and there’s only 10 seconds left on the clock. B-Dawg loses to his opponent. Pan across stunned faces of B-Dawg fans. The opponents fans boo and B-Dawg hangs his head and leaves the gym. Fade to black.


Open on B-Dawg sitting at a bar. A bartender walks over.


Bartender: What’ll it be, B-Dawg?


B-Dawg: I’ll have a root beer.


Bartender: Coming right up. He takes the can and gives it to B-Dawg, who opens it and takes a sip.


B-Dawg: Gee, I sure am sad. I lost the 1-on-1 B-Ball Tournament and disappointed my fans. I used to be the basketball star, but now I need basketball CPR.


Bartender: I knew a basketball sensei once. He could probably help you get your game back to the top. His basketball dojo is at 123 Maple Street.


B-Dawg: I will go there once I finish this root beer.


He finishes his root beer and sets it on the table.


B-Dawg: I finished it. I will go to the basketball dojo now. Thanks and goodbye. See you later.


B-Dawg walks out of the bar, and gets into his car, driven by Richard Swag.


B-Dawg: Take me to 123 Maple Street. There’s a basketball dojo there that I want to attend.


Cut to 123 Maple Street. B-Dawg exits the car and it drives away.


B-Dawg: Well, I guess this is it.


He knocks on the door. The basketball sensei comes to the door.


Sensei: Do you need basketball help? I can teach you the ways of the B-Ball masters.


B-Dawg: Yes. I would like to be taught the ways of the B-Ball masters.


They both walk in. The sensei takes out an old map from a drawer and shows it to him. They walk to a room with a table and sit down.


Sensei: Do you see the temple there? You must journey there and bring back the Magic Basketball. It will be a difficult journey and you will need many supplies and intensive training. Do 20 sit ups and 5 pushups, then make 5 layups. That will be the start of your exercise training.


Cut to exercise montage.


B-Dawg drinks from a water bottle. I guess I’m ready to go now


Sensei: Yes, you need equipment first. Take the basketball ninja headband, the map, and this backpack. It has all the food and water you’ll need. And take this basketball katana.


Cut to stolen Indiana Jones travel montage. When finished, open to road near Chaminoux BBQ pavilion. A car pulls up with Richard Swag in the driver’s seat and B-Dawg in the pssgr. seat. They both get out with guns. B-Dawg scans the area.


B-Dawg: What’s that over there? OH NO! It’s M-Awesome! I guess he wasn’t content to just beat me fair and square. He had to cheat.


Richard Swag: It looks like he has a gang gangster with him. A RIVAL ninja gang gangster. My former rival ninja gang gangster J-Radical!


B-Dawg and Richard Swag draw their short swords and walk up. M-Awesome and J-Radical see them and M-Awesome draws his longsword. J-Radical draws his dagger.


Richard Swag, to J-Radical: So you still want to fight me. Remember when you were my rival ninja gang gangster.


J-Radical: YES!!!!!!!


B-Dawg: M-Awesome! I guess you aren’t content with beating me fair and square and now you’re cheating too!


M-Awesome: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!


There is a big fight. It is a fair match except M-Awesome and J-Radical disarm B-Dawg and Richard Swag with magic and tie them.


Richard Swag: B-Dawg, this is a huge problem!


B-Dawg: You can say that again.


A loud gunshot shoots and J-Radical falls down. He crawls away into the bushes. M-Awesome puts his hands up. T-Awesome runs up the road in a camo suit with a Nerf rifle. J-Radical runs up the road and they engage in a firefight. B-Dawg punches M-Awesome and M-Awesome falls down. He guards the metallic basketball as Richard Swag pulls out a scoped pistol and snipes the guy that T-Awesome was fighting. T-Awesome and Richard Swag run back to the pavilion.


T-Awesome: I guess I saved your lives.


Richard Swag: Yeah, thanks, T-Awesome!


B-Dawg: Someone tie up M-Awesome to keep him from escaping. Oh crap, he’s getting away!


Pan to M-Awesome running down the road. B-Dawg takes his sword and throws it. Cut to sword hitting M-Awesome.


B-Dawg: Serves him right! Now, the sensei said I had to touch the Magic B-Ball.


He walks up to a metallic basketball sitting on the table. He touches the basketball. Insert cheesy special effects now.


B-Dawg: Wow. I am filled with all the B-Ball knowledge.


They leave the temple and get in the car, after tying up M-Awesome and bandaging his wound. They take J-Radical’s body and put it in the trunk. Fade to black.


2 weeks later. B-Dawg has called a Remix game against the guy who beat him earlier. The score is the same and B-Dawg is still losing. He almost scores enough to win, but the other guy scores again. At the last second, the basketball sensei runs in, takes the ball from the guy, and dunks it.


Sensei: Congratulations, B-Dawg! You beat him fair and square. You earned it.
