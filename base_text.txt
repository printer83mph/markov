Follow their zany, action-packed adventure as they team up with local armed hillbillies to chase down the evildoers! Watch as the head security guard John Smith and the hillbilly mayor Cletus Johnson go head to head with the Commie commander Ivan Evilovski and his commie goons in this fun-filled movie!


General idea of the story:
A bank in Springfield, USA is home to secret papers and a large amount of gold coins belonging to the US government. A large amount of commies has somehow been able to pass through the heavily defended border undetected (It will be revealed that the commies were in league with the president Bigg Bankes). These commies are tasked with stealing the papers and gold from the bank. The security guards at the bank are woefully  inexperienced, and are assisted by  local hillbillies and are eventually saved(?) by the US Army in a climactic battle.


FLOW:


8:00 - Security guards take positions around bank (Mansion). The commies start walking toward the bank from slightly down the main path. Hillbillies are talking, drinking, playing ball, tailgating party, etc. in baseball field, (With baseball equip., etc). then run out of beer. They need more money, so they go to the bank. They have a shooting target of a generic Democrat president. (I made one with Photoshop).


8:10 - Commies reach bank. They order the guards to surrender. For this story to work at least half the guards need to surrender and go with the commies. Other guards may surrender, fight, or hide. One guard calls the US Army on his cellphone. The commies take a money sack (sitting on the porch) then leave with the captured guards. The hillbillies amble in and the commies may be leaving or getting ready to leave, but the hillbillies will fight them. The commies can lose a few people but they need to keep the guards captured.


8:35 - Commies run to the bridge bottom with the guards, making their presence known to the hillbillies chasing them, but the commies execute most of the guards with the line “Now is time for Russia Roulette, however, it is rig this time,” while they play the Russian national anthem on their phones. (Not ingame, but we just need a way to play the music). The commies try torturing the guards for “information on secret papers” by inflicting non-lethal wounds on the the security guards. The russian torturer is named Sergei Tuertureovski. The hillbillies come and scare off the commies by accidentally firing a bunch of cap guns (Cletus should also set off a sound grenade). Commies run to the side path, and start planning on how to steal the papers from the bank.


8:45 - Commies run to the side path, and start planning on how to steal the papers from the bank. Hillbillies and security guards take the path to the stairs, then to the baseball field where they treat the wounds of the security guards WITH ALKYHALL.


9:00 - The commies try returning to the bank and make it. There, they call in reinforcements. At this point the commie and HB groups should be about equal in number of players.


9:10 - Guards and hillbillies return to the mansion and see the commies on the back porch going through the papers. A country singer named Big Lenny Keith is in town but his bus has broken down, and the singer and a few of his staff are walking to the bank to call for help. They should come out of the production path and see the hillbillies and decide to ask them for help first, since they are Good Honest Working Class American Patriots and not Evil City Folk Bankers. HB’s tell the singer about the commie invasion, and he pulls out his twin revolvers and vows to help. “These communistic invaders may have caused the Great Depression, they may have started both World Wars, sunk the Titanic, started the War of Northern Aggression, created Democrats, and assassinated George Washington, but they won’t claim another American life on MY watch!” A few people in his group may have more practical guns.


9:15 - Guards/singer/HB’s (GSHB) charge  behind the bank. Cool close-quarters fighting ensues. The hillbilly elder is killed while dueling (the hillbilly just stumbles around confused and is killed easily.) Ivan Evilovski with his pickaxe (from the gold rush), and Ivan kills him. However, the GHB manages to retake the bank, but most of the commies are still alive. The GHB’s notice that they are running low on ammo, and if some people still have some, they should put it away. “Let’s put our ammo away to keep it safe. I think we’ve sent them running.”


9:25 - The commies take the baseball path to the field, where they find the hillbillies’ campsite, where they take extra ammo after executing Re/the hillbilly guarding it (Re can come back to life). The GSHBs can celebrate their “victory” (not knowing that the commies will come back) by having a tavern scene and target practice with empty alcohol bottles at the mansion .


9:45 - The commies return to the mansion via Chamounix Drive, and another battle ensues, but most of the GSHBs’ weapons are stashed away, leaving them at a disadvantage. During the battle, the GSHB’s are losing, but the singer leads them in deliberately off-key, bad, and cheesy country patriotic songs, as the commies fall down screaming and clutching their ears. They are captured and led into the bank.


10:00 - The commies are captured and led into the bank, held in the room with the secret papers, where a HB watches them. One asks for a drink of water and the HB goes to get it, and the commies escape (with the conveniently placed papers) while they are away.


10:05 - They go back under the bridge, and contact the evil president Bigg Bankes and give him the papers because he hired them and allowed them to pass through. GHB’s see them escape and chase after them,  also witnessing the interaction with Bigg Bankes. Bigg Bankes pulls out dual large pistols, and threatens them to not say anything, and not to worry because a nuke will be launched for Springfield in 1 hour. Bigg Bankes escapes with the commies in the direction of the mansion, and when they get there, they decide to take a minute for a drink of beer.


10:25 - The GSHB go to the pavilion where they reach the local guns store. They talk with the manager, who supplies them all with guns.


10:40 - The GSHB reach the mansion to see the commies stealing their alcohol and partying. As they are moving in, they see another group come up from the baseball field path, (or Chamounix Drive if a car is available), the US military.  Final battle ensues, if commies win then game is called, if GSHB win they first need to use the US army’s radio to cancel the nuke, then game is called.
